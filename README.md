# neural_network
My first neural network model. Data is from Keras dataset fashion_mnist. Fashion MNist dataset is 70,000 images of  garments and footwear in 10 categories. Separated 60,000 images is used for the training of the model and 10,000 images is set aside for testing the accuracy of the model. The model has an input and an output layer fully connected.
